msgid "Graph convolutional neural networks are applied in state-of-the-art models for skeleton-based action recognition. The focus of this work is to research the combination of this type of neural network and data from multiple modalities. Using skeletal data as a base for a graph convolutional network model, multiple approaches for fusion of skeleton, RGB and other sensor modalities are proposed. Experiments are conducted on the two multimodal datasets <a href=\"https://personal.utdallas.edu/~kehtar/UTD-MHAD.html\" target=\"_blank\">UTD-MHAD</a> and <a href=\"https://mmact19.github.io/2019/\" target=\"_blank\">MMAct</a> using various graph-like representations of modalities and their fusion at different stages of the neural network architecture."

If both skeleton joints and IMU signals are represented by three-dimensional values (xyz), the skeleton graph can be augmented by simply appending additional nodes representing IMU (or other modalities)."

msgid "Regarding the skeleton-based approach as the base model, experiments to investigate benefits of multimodal approaches show that multiple fusion methods of skeleton and inertial sensor data achieve better classification accuracies than the base model on UTD-MHAD while a slight decrease in performance is noticeable on MMAct. The approaches for fusion of skeleton and RGB, while experiencing high accuracies on several training runs, similarly show a slight decrease in performance over the base model in the majority of cases."

msgid "People tracking, which is required for following people, is a challenging subject. The task is to identify the same person within an arbitrary number of time-shifted image frames and to prevent a mismatch, that is, recognizing something/someone else as the target. Since this is a visual recognition task, re-identification is further complicated by occlusion (esp. by other people or taking abrupt turns through doors), lighting, video quality and clothes/appearance in combination with viewing a person from different angles. Furthermore, following requires the robot to drive behind the operator at a comfortable distance while avoiding obstacles which inevitably results in it losing its operator."

msgid "Using ROS with C++, two packages <i>people-tracking</i> and <i>people-following</i> are created that communicate with each other. The former is responsible for tracking people between frames based on RGB-D images from Kinect, OpenPose detections and OpenCV. A feature vector is computed for each detection and matched with all existing tracks using Hungarian algorithm. Similarity metrics are euclidean distance of last known positions, euclidean distance of predicted positions using Unscented Kalman Filter, histogram comparison using Bhattacharyya distance, distance of face detection embeddings and an online classifier based on <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325854919_Convolutional_Channel_Features-Based_Person_Identification_for_Person_Following_Robots\">this paper</a> (using features of a person reid neural network forwarded into online AdaBoost). The most reliable method is face detection which is not very useful to re-identify a followed person when the robot drives behind its target. <i>people-following</i> subscribes to the robot's base pose and camera pose and receives tracking data to publish commands that adjust the camera's position, turn the robot or drive to a location."

One of the most frequently used statements is about a random two-child family where at least one of the children is a boy and asked for is the probability of them having two boys. When intuitively answering these types of questions, people's opinions about the correct solution and method of achieving said solution differ. When dealing with conditional probabilities, people often apply simple mental models that either lead to a wrong solution or may be correct for a particular problem but don't transfer to other problems."

As for statement 2, two of the four cases are unreachable and so the resulting probability is 1/2.

This results in a large variance for MCI and would be inefficient for strongly reflective surfaces."
